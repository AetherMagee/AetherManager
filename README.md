## What can it do?
- **Manage your chat** - Basic commands like /mute, /ban, /kick are of course incuded to the bot!
- **Protect your chat** - Prevent bot users from joining by smart captcha, which always has up-to-date detection patterns and only annoys bots, while keeping good people away from ads and scam!
- **Keep your chat clean** - Instead of sending messages about its actions and keeping it, AetherManager always cleans up after it, thats why your chat will look cleaner than before
## What is planned to be made?
- **Spam protection**

## AetherManager's disadvantages
- **Only russian** - This is sad, but currently this bot only speaks Russian
