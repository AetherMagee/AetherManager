# AetherManager [DISCONTINUED]
AetherManager is a Telegram bot powered by Telethon, which was created to simplify the process of managing your chats while keeping it clean from notifications about it's actions, spam bots, etc.
## What can it do?
- **Manage your chat** - Basic commands like /mute, /ban, /kick are of course incuded to the bot!
- **Protect your chat** - Prevent bot users from joining by smart captcha, which always has up-to-date detection patterns and only annoys bots, while keeping good people away from ads and scam!
- **Keep your chat clean** - Instead of sending messages about its actions and keeping it, AetherManager always cleans up after it, thats why your chat will look cleaner than before.
- **Save important stuff with notes and filters** - We also have a note system which can store information and make it easily accessible to anyone in the chat. Filters, in other hand, can be used to, for example, reply with some information when some word is spelled. This can be useful in some tech-chats to let newbies get reqired information immediately while not bothering everyone else with questions.


## What is planned to be made?
- **Spam protection**
- **Extend filters functionality** - Filters right now can only reply with a text. Im planning to make it able to mute/ban/etc when it triggers

## AetherManager's disadvantages
- **Only russian** - This is sad, but currently this bot only speaks Russian
